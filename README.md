# Master Thesis: Unsupervised Learning for Detection of Rare Driving Scenarios

This project explores unsupervised learning to identify rare driving scenarios using multivariate time series data from autonomous vehicle perception systems. The main technique is Deep Isolation Forest, a state-of-the-art method for detecting contextual anomalies.

Part of this work has been accepted for publication at the **IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC) 2025**, to be held in **Gold Coast, Australia**.
